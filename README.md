A relational  database has been created
in MySQL 
to store details about
badminton clubs in a county
. 
There are five tables
in the database
: 
club
, 
member
, 
team
, 
teamPlayer
and 
fixture
. 
A member is 
registered with a 
specific club; each club may have one or more teams. Some members are selected to 
play for a team.
A match between
two teams in a division 
takes place at the venue of the home 
team club. 
Results of 
all
match
es
are recorded 
in
the 
fixture
table.

For this assessment I recieved a mark of 98/100.
